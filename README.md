# About

In February 2018, lightshot (https://app.prntscr.com/en/index.html) rolled out an update making it difficult to view the source URL of screenshot images. This Chrome extension automatically redirects you to the source image when you open a prnt.sc URL.

# How to Install

* Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/RyanHecht/fix-lightshot` *OR* [download this as a ZIP](https://github.com/RyanHecht/fix-lightshot/archive/master.zip) and extract it to a folder of your choosing

* In Chrome, navigate to `chrome://extensions`

* Check 'Developer mode' in the top right

* Click on "Load unpacked extension" in the top left

* Navigate to the `fix-lightshot` folder

* Press Ctrl+R

* Navigate to `https://prnt.sc/ih5tj9`

* After the normal lightshot page loads, you should automatically be redirected to the source page of the image!
